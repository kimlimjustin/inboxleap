        MULTI-LANGUAGE EMAIL PARSING: Parse this email into actionable tasks in ANY language. Understand and extract tasks regardless of the language used (English, Spanish, French, German, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Portuguese, Italian, Dutch, Arabic, Hindi, Swedish, Turkish, Polish, Vietnamese, Thai, Indonesian, Norwegian, Finnish, etc.).
        
        CRITICAL: This is a REPLY EMAIL in an existing thread. Be smart about avoiding duplicates while allowing legitimate recurring tasks.
        
        CURRENT DATE AND TIME: ${new Date().toISOString()} (${new Date().toLocaleDateString('en-US', { weekday: 'long', year: 'numeric', month: 'long', day: 'numeric' })})
        
        Email Subject: ${subject}
        Email Body: ${body}${participantsList}${senderInfo}${pendingTasksList}
        
        IMPORTANT RULES FOR REPLY EMAILS:
        - DO NOT create tasks that duplicate PENDING or IN-PROGRESS tasks listed above
        - ALLOW recurring tasks that might be similar to completed tasks (e.g., "daily standup", "weekly report") 
        - Extract NEW task requests regardless of the language used
        - Allow legitimate recurring tasks even if similar tasks exist in completed status
        - Ignore status updates about existing tasks
        - For recurring tasks, look for time indicators in any language
        
        UNIVERSAL ASSIGNMENT PATTERNS (All Languages):
        Look for assignment patterns in ANY language:
        - Direct assignment: "John, please handle this" / "Juan, por favor encárgate de esto" / "Jean, s'il te plaît occupe-toi de ça" / "John，请处理这个" / "ジョン、これを処理してください" / "John, molim te rijesi ovo" / etc.
        - Task assignment: "Task for Alice" / "Tarea para Alice" / "Tâche pour Alice" / "Alice的任务" / "Aliceのタスク" / etc.
        - Email assignment: "(alice@company.com)" or "(alice)" after a task in any language
        - @ mentions: "@john" or equivalent username references
        - Multi-person assignment: "John and Alice should work on this" in any language equivalent
        - Username matching: Match usernames/handles to project participants regardless of language context
        - MULTI-LINE ASSIGNMENT PATTERN: "name:" followed by multiple tasks works universally
        
        UNIVERSAL SELF-ASSIGNMENT PATTERNS (All Languages):
        Detect self-assignment in any language:
        - English: "I'll do this", "I can handle that", "I'll take care of it", "Let me do this"
        - Spanish: "Lo haré yo", "Puedo hacer eso", "Me haré cargo", "Déjame hacer esto"
        - French: "Je vais faire ça", "Je peux faire ça", "Je vais m'en charger", "Laisse-moi faire ça"
        - German: "Ich werde das machen", "Ich kann das machen", "Ich übernehme das", "Lass mich das machen"
        - Chinese: "我来做这个", "我可以做那个", "我来负责", "让我来做这个"
        - Japanese: "私がやります", "私にできます", "私が担当します", "私にやらせてください"
        - And equivalent patterns in ALL other languages (Korean, Russian, Portuguese, Italian, Dutch, Arabic, Hindi, etc.)
        
        COMPLEX SENTENCE PARSING EDGE CASES:
        - Conditional assignments: "If John is available, he should handle the deployment, otherwise assign it to Sarah"
        - Multiple conditional tasks: "Depending on the client feedback, either update the design (Alice) or revise the proposal (Bob)"
        - Sequential dependencies: "After Alice finishes the database setup, then Bob can start the API development"
        - Alternative assignments: "Either Mike or Jennifer can review the documentation"
        - Nested task descriptions: "Create a comprehensive project plan that includes: 1) timeline analysis (Sarah), 2) resource allocation (Mike), 3) risk assessment (Jennifer)"
        - Compound sentences with multiple tasks: "We need to prepare the presentation slides and also update the client database, with John handling slides and Mary handling database updates"
        - Parenthetical assignments: "The quarterly review needs to be completed (preferably by Alice or Bob) before the board meeting"
        - Role-based assignments: "The project manager should coordinate with stakeholders while the developer implements the changes"
        - Time-sensitive cascading tasks: "If we don't hear back from the client by tomorrow, proceed with Plan B (Tom), but if we do get approval, execute Plan A (Lisa)"
        - Implied subject continuation: "John should handle the user research, conduct the interviews, and compile the final report" (all three tasks assigned to John)
        - Cross-referenced assignments: "The task mentioned in Sarah's email from last week should now be assigned to Mike instead"
        - Negative conditions: "Unless Bob is unavailable, he should take care of the server maintenance"
        - Priority-based assignments: "High priority items go to Alice, medium priority to Bob, low priority can be handled by anyone on the team"
        - Skill-based assignments: "Technical tasks for the development team (John, Sarah, Mike), design tasks for the creative team (Lisa, Tom)"
        - Backup assignments: "Primary assignee: Alice, backup if unavailable: Bob, final fallback: anyone from the tech team"
        - Complex temporal assignments: "Week 1: Sarah handles setup, Week 2: Mike takes over testing, Week 3: Alice does final review"
        - Collaborative assignments with roles: "Joint task for Alice (research lead) and Bob (data analyst) to complete the market analysis"
        - Exclusive assignments: "Only Sarah should handle the sensitive client data migration, no one else"
        - Group assignments with individual responsibilities: "Team task: everyone reviews the proposal, but John compiles the final feedback"
        - Conditional self-assignment: "I'll handle this myself unless someone with more experience volunteers"
        
        For due dates, look for natural language patterns and convert to ISO format using the current date above:
        - "before 23 july" → "2025-07-23T00:00:00Z"
        - "by end of week" → calculate end of current week based on current date
        - "next monday" → calculate next monday from current date
        - "in 3 days" → calculate 3 days from current date
        - "by friday" → calculate next friday from current date
        - "end of month" → calculate last day of current month
        - "tomorrow" → calculate tomorrow's date from current date
        - "next week" → calculate one week from current date
        - "asap" or "urgent" → set to tomorrow from current date
        - "due today" → set to current date
        - "this week" → set to end of current week
        - "this month" → set to end of current month
        
        IMPORTANT: Also detect SELF-ASSIGNMENT patterns where the sender assigns tasks to themselves.
        
        THREAD CONTEXT AWARENESS: When parsing replies, consider the thread context:
        - If someone replies to a task assignment with "great, I'll start doing it by now", they're accepting their assigned task
        - Look for confirmation patterns like "I'll start", "I'll begin", "I'll get on it", "sounds good, I'll handle it"
        - If the reply is confirming work on something they were previously assigned, extract that as a task update
        - Pay attention to references to "it", "this", "that" which often refer to previously assigned tasks
        - Consider the email subject line for context about what "it" refers to
        
        Self-assignment patterns include:
        - "I'll do this" or "I'll handle this"
        - "I can do that" or "I can handle that"
        - "I'll take care of it" or "I'll work on it"
        - "Let me do this" or "Let me handle this"
        - "I'll get on this" or "I'll take this on"
        - "Oh yeah, I'll do xxxx too"
        - "I will do this" or "I will handle this"
        - "I'm going to do this" or "I'm gonna do this"
        - "I should do this" or "I need to do this"
        - "I'll make sure to do this"
        - "I'll get this done"
        - "I can also take care for [task]"
        - "I can also take care of [task]"
        - "I'll also do [task]"
        - "I'll do xxx" (where xxx is any task description)
        - "I can take care of xxx"
        - "I'll handle xxx"
        - "I'll work on xxx"
        - "I can also handle xxx"
        - "I'll also handle xxx"
        - "I can also work on xxx"
        - "I'll also work on xxx"
        - "I can manage xxx"
        - "I'll manage xxx"
        - "I can deal with xxx"
        - "I'll deal with xxx"
        - "I can cover xxx"
        - "I'll cover xxx"
        - "I can sort out xxx"
        - "I'll sort out xxx"
        - "I can look after xxx"
        - "I'll look after xxx"
        - "I can see to xxx"
        - "I'll see to xxx"
        
        When self-assignment is detected, assign the task to the email sender.
        
        Please respond with a JSON array of tasks, where each task has:
        - title (required): A clear, actionable task title
        - description (optional): More detailed description if needed
        - priority (optional): "low", "medium", or "high" based on urgency indicators
        - status (optional): "pending", "in-progress", "review", "blocked", or "completed" based on email context
        - dueDate (optional): If a date is mentioned, format as ISO string. Parse natural language dates using the current date provided above:
          * "before 23 july" → "2025-07-23T00:00:00Z"
          * "by end of week" → calculate end of current week from current date
          * "next monday" → calculate next monday from current date
          * "in 3 days" → calculate 3 days from current date
          * "by friday" → calculate next friday from current date
          * "end of month" → calculate last day of current month
          * "tomorrow" → calculate tomorrow's date from current date
          * "next week" → calculate one week from current date
          * "asap" or "urgent" → set to tomorrow from current date
        - assignees (optional): Array of email addresses or names mentioned as assignees
        
        Rules:
        - Only extract genuine NEW actionable tasks that aren't duplicates of PENDING/IN-PROGRESS tasks
        - ALLOW recurring tasks even if similar completed tasks exist (e.g., "daily report", "weekly standup")
        - Don't create tasks for casual conversation or FYI information  
        - Don't create tasks for status updates about existing tasks
        - IMPORTANT: Even simple, short messages can be tasks (e.g., "go home", "call john", "buy milk", "fix bug")
        - If the entire email content appears to be a single actionable item, treat it as a task
        - Be concise but clear in task titles
        - If no clear NEW tasks are found, return an empty array
        - For recurring tasks, include time context in the title (e.g., "Daily standup - January 8th", "Weekly report - Week 2")
        - IMPORTANT: For assignees, ALWAYS try to match names/usernames to the project participants list provided above
        - When you see usernames like "jsph273", "john", etc., look for matching participants by:
          * Exact email match (jsph273@gmail.com)
          * Username part of email (jsph273 matches jsph273@gmail.com)
          * Name similarity (John matches john.doe@company.com)
        - If someone is mentioned in parentheses after a task, they are likely the assignee
        - ONLY use exact participant emails or usernames that can be matched to participants
        - Do NOT create new email addresses - only use participants from the provided list
        - CRITICAL: Handle multi-line assignments where a person's name is followed by a colon and multiple tasks:
          * If you see "PersonName:" followed by multiple task lines, assign ALL those tasks to PersonName
          * Example: If email contains "nulia:\n(task 1)\n(task 2)\n(task 3)", assign tasks 1, 2, and 3 ALL to nulia
          * This pattern indicates grouped assignment - all subsequent tasks belong to the person named above
          * Look for variations: "John:", "alice@company.com:", "sarah:", etc.
        - If self-assignment is detected (I'll do, I can do, I can also take care for, etc.), assign to the email sender
        - Pay special attention to "I can also take care for" and "I'll do xxx" patterns for self-assignment
        - When extracting tasks from self-assignment patterns, extract the actual task from the context (xxx part)
        - Parse natural language dates intelligently using the current date provided above - "before 23 july" means due by July 23rd
        - When parsing relative dates, use the current date and time provided above as the reference point
        - For ambiguous dates like "friday", assume the next upcoming friday from the current date
        - Convert all dates to ISO format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ)
        
        ADVANCED PARSING RULES FOR COMPLEX SENTENCES:
        - Handle conditional statements: Extract primary and fallback assignments, create separate tasks if conditions are uncertain
        - For sequential dependencies: Create separate tasks but note dependencies in descriptions
        - With alternative assignments: Create one task and assign to first mentioned person, or all alternatives if unclear
        - For nested structures: Break down numbered/bulleted sub-tasks into separate task entries
        - For compound sentences: Parse each distinct task separately even within same sentence
        - With parenthetical preferences: Treat parenthetical mentions as assignment suggestions
        - Handle implied continuation: If multiple tasks follow one assignee mention, assign all to that person
        - For role-based assignments: Try to match roles to specific participants when possible
        - With time-based cascading: Create tasks for all scenarios mentioned
        - Handle skill-based routing: Route to appropriate team members based on context
        - For collaborative tasks: Assign to all mentioned collaborators
        - With exclusive assignments: Create single task with specific assignee only
        - For group tasks with individual roles: Create separate tasks for individual responsibilities
        - Handle backup/fallback assignments: Use primary assignee, note alternatives in description
        
        Example format:
        [
          {
            "title": "Review quarterly budget report",
            "description": "Complete analysis of Q4 financial performance",
            "priority": "high",
            "status": "pending",

        ]
        
        Multi-line assignment example:
        If email contains:
        "nulia:
        (update database schema)
        (fix login bug)
        (deploy to staging)"
        
        Result should be:
        [
          {
            "title": "Update database schema",
            "priority": "medium",

        MULTI-LANGUAGE EMAIL PARSING: Parse this email into actionable tasks in ANY language. Understand and extract tasks regardless of the language used (English, Spanish, French, German, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Portuguese, Italian, Dutch, Arabic, Hindi, Swedish, Turkish, Polish, Vietnamese, Thai, Indonesian, Norwegian, Finnish, etc.).

        Email Body: ${body}${participantsList}${senderInfo}
        
        For assignees, look for patterns like:

        - "Task for Alice" or "Alice should do this"
        - "(alice@company.com)" or "(alice)" after a task
        - "@john" or "assign to john"
        - "John and Alice should work on this"
        - "jsph273" or other usernames/handles should be matched to project participants
        - MULTI-LINE ASSIGNMENT PATTERN: "name:" followed by multiple tasks
          Example:
          nulia:
          (todo task 1)
          (todo task 2)
          (todo task 3)
          → ALL tasks should be assigned to "nulia"
        - When you see "PersonName:" followed by multiple tasks/items in subsequent lines, assign ALL those tasks to PersonName
        - This pattern works with variations like "John:", "alice:", "sarah@company.com:", etc.
        
        COMPLEX SENTENCE PARSING EDGE CASES:
        - Conditional assignments: "If John is available, he should handle the deployment, otherwise assign it to Sarah"
        - Multiple conditional tasks: "Depending on the client feedback, either update the design (Alice) or revise the proposal (Bob)"
        - Sequential dependencies: "After Alice finishes the database setup, then Bob can start the API development"
        - Alternative assignments: "Either Mike or Jennifer can review the documentation"
        - Nested task descriptions: "Create a comprehensive project plan that includes: 1) timeline analysis (Sarah), 2) resource allocation (Mike), 3) risk assessment (Jennifer)"
        - Compound sentences with multiple tasks: "We need to prepare the presentation slides and also update the client database, with John handling slides and Mary handling database updates"
        - Parenthetical assignments: "The quarterly review needs to be completed (preferably by Alice or Bob) before the board meeting"
        - Role-based assignments: "The project manager should coordinate with stakeholders while the developer implements the changes"
        - Time-sensitive cascading tasks: "If we don't hear back from the client by tomorrow, proceed with Plan B (Tom), but if we do get approval, execute Plan A (Lisa)"
        - Implied subject continuation: "John should handle the user research, conduct the interviews, and compile the final report" (all three tasks assigned to John)
        - Cross-referenced assignments: "The task mentioned in Sarah's email from last week should now be assigned to Mike instead"
        - Negative conditions: "Unless Bob is unavailable, he should take care of the server maintenance"
        - Priority-based assignments: "High priority items go to Alice, medium priority to Bob, low priority can be handled by anyone on the team"
        - Skill-based assignments: "Technical tasks for the development team (John, Sarah, Mike), design tasks for the creative team (Lisa, Tom)"
        - Backup assignments: "Primary assignee: Alice, backup if unavailable: Bob, final fallback: anyone from the tech team"
        - Complex temporal assignments: "Week 1: Sarah handles setup, Week 2: Mike takes over testing, Week 3: Alice does final review"
        - Collaborative assignments with roles: "Joint task for Alice (research lead) and Bob (data analyst) to complete the market analysis"
        - Exclusive assignments: "Only Sarah should handle the sensitive client data migration, no one else"
        - Group assignments with individual responsibilities: "Team task: everyone reviews the proposal, but John compiles the final feedback"
        - Conditional self-assignment: "I'll handle this myself unless someone with more experience volunteers"
        
        For due dates, look for natural language patterns and convert to ISO format using the current date above:
        - "before 23 july" → "2025-07-23T00:00:00Z"
        - "by end of week" → calculate end of current week based on current date
        - "next monday" → calculate next monday from current date
        - "in 3 days" → calculate 3 days from current date
        - "by friday" → calculate next friday from current date
        - "end of month" → calculate last day of current month
        - "tomorrow" → calculate tomorrow's date from current date
        - "next week" → calculate one week from current date
        - "asap" or "urgent" → set to tomorrow from current date
        - "due today" → set to current date
        - "this week" → set to end of current week
        - "this month" → set to end of current month
        
        IMPORTANT: Also detect SELF-ASSIGNMENT patterns where the sender assigns tasks to themselves.
        
        THREAD CONTEXT AWARENESS: When parsing replies, consider the thread context:
        - If someone replies to a task assignment with "great, I'll start doing it by now", they're accepting their assigned task
        - Look for confirmation patterns like "I'll start", "I'll begin", "I'll get on it", "sounds good, I'll handle it"
        - If the reply is confirming work on something they were previously assigned, extract that as a task update
        - Pay attention to references to "it", "this", "that" which often refer to previously assigned tasks
        - Consider the email subject line for context about what "it" refers to
        
        Self-assignment patterns include:
        - "I'll do this" or "I'll handle this"
        - "I can do that" or "I can handle that"
        - "I'll take care of it" or "I'll work on it"
        - "Let me do this" or "Let me handle this"
        - "I'll get on this" or "I'll take this on"
        - "Oh yeah, I'll do xxxx too"
        - "I will do this" or "I will handle this"
        - "I'm going to do this" or "I'm gonna do this"
        - "I should do this" or "I need to do this"
        - "I'll make sure to do this"
        - "I'll get this done"
        - "I can also take care for [task]"
        - "I can also take care of [task]"
        - "I'll also do [task]"
        - "I'll do xxx" (where xxx is any task description)
        - "I can take care of xxx"
        - "I'll handle xxx"
        - "I'll work on xxx"
        - "I can also handle xxx"
        - "I'll also handle xxx"
        - "I can also work on xxx"
        - "I'll also work on xxx"
        - "I can manage xxx"
        - "I'll manage xxx"
        - "I can deal with xxx"
        - "I'll deal with xxx"
        - "I can cover xxx"
        - "I'll cover xxx"
        - "I can sort out xxx"
        - "I'll sort out xxx"
        - "I can look after xxx"
        - "I'll look after xxx"
        - "I can see to xxx"
        - "I'll see to xxx"
        
        When self-assignment is detected, assign the task to the email sender.
        
        Please respond with a JSON array of tasks, where each task has:
        - title (required): A clear, actionable task title
        - description (optional): More detailed description if needed
        - priority (optional): "low", "medium", or "high" based on urgency indicators
        - status (optional): "pending", "in-progress", "review", "blocked", or "completed" based on email context
        - dueDate (optional): If a date is mentioned, format as ISO string. Parse natural language dates using the current date provided above:
          * "before 23 july" → "2025-07-23T00:00:00Z"
          * "by end of week" → calculate end of current week from current date
          * "next monday" → calculate next monday from current date
          * "in 3 days" → calculate 3 days from current date
          * "by friday" → calculate next friday from current date
          * "end of month" → calculate last day of current month
          * "tomorrow" → calculate tomorrow's date from current date
          * "next week" → calculate one week from current date
          * "asap" or "urgent" → set to tomorrow from current date
        - assignees (optional): Array of email addresses or names mentioned as assignees
        
        Rules:
        - Only extract genuine actionable tasks
        - Don't create tasks for casual conversation or FYI information
        - IMPORTANT: Even simple, short messages can be tasks (e.g., "go home", "call john", "buy milk", "fix bug")
        - If the entire email content appears to be a single actionable item, treat it as a task
        - Be concise but clear in task titles
        - If no clear tasks are found, return an empty array
        - IMPORTANT: For assignees, ALWAYS try to match names/usernames to the project participants list provided above
        - When you see usernames like "jsph273", "john", etc., look for matching participants by:
          * Exact email match (jsph273@gmail.com)
          * Username part of email (jsph273 matches jsph273@gmail.com)
          * Name similarity (John matches john.doe@company.com)
        - If someone is mentioned in parentheses after a task, they are likely the assignee
        - ONLY use exact participant emails or usernames that can be matched to participants
        - Do NOT create new email addresses - only use participants from the provided list
        - CRITICAL: Handle multi-line assignments where a person's name is followed by a colon and multiple tasks:
          * If you see "PersonName:" followed by multiple task lines, assign ALL those tasks to PersonName
          * Example: If email contains "nulia:\n(task 1)\n(task 2)\n(task 3)", assign tasks 1, 2, and 3 ALL to nulia
          * This pattern indicates grouped assignment - all subsequent tasks belong to the person named above
          * Look for variations: "John:", "alice@company.com:", "sarah:", etc.
        - If self-assignment is detected (I'll do, I can do, I can also take care for, etc.), assign to the email sender
        - Pay special attention to "I can also take care for" and "I'll do xxx" patterns for self-assignment
        - When extracting tasks from self-assignment patterns, extract the actual task from the context (xxx part)
        - Parse natural language dates intelligently using the current date provided above - "before 23 july" means due by July 23rd
        - When parsing relative dates, use the current date and time provided above as the reference point
        - For ambiguous dates like "friday", assume the next upcoming friday from the current date
        - Convert all dates to ISO format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ)
        
        Example format:
        [

        "nulia:
        (update database schema)
        (fix login bug)

        Email Subject: ${subject}
        Email Body: ${body}${tasksContext}

        THREAD CONTEXT AWARENESS: This is likely a reply to a previous email. Consider thread context:
        - If someone says "great, I'll start doing it by now" or "I'll get on it", they're likely accepting/starting their assigned task
        - When they say "it", "this", "that", they're often referring to tasks they were previously assigned
        - Look for confirmation patterns: "I'll start", "I'll begin", "I'll get on it", "sounds good, I'll handle it"
        - If the reply confirms work on something, infer the task from the subject line and existing tasks
        - Pay attention to pronouns and context clues that reference previous assignments

        Please match what the user is saying in their reply to the existing tasks above. The user may not use the exact same wording as the task title, so use your intelligence to match:
        - Similar keywords or concepts
        - Context from the original subject or content
        - Reasonable interpretations of what the user is referring to
        - Thread context - what they might be replying to based on their assignment

        Please respond with ONLY a JSON array of task updates. Each update should have:
        - taskId: The ID of the matching existing task (must match one from the list above)
        - taskTitle: The original task title from the existing tasks
        - newStatus: The new status ("completed", "in-progress", "pending", "blocked", "review")

        Common patterns to look for:
        - "X is done" or "X is completed" → status: "completed"
        - "Working on X" or "Started X" → status: "in-progress"
        - "X is blocked" → status: "blocked"
        - "X needs review" → status: "review"
        - "Haven't started X yet" → status: "pending"
        
        Thread context confirmation patterns:
        - "great, I'll start doing it by now" → status: "in-progress" (for their assigned task)
        - "I'll get on it" → status: "in-progress" (for their assigned task)
        - "I'll begin working on this" → status: "in-progress" (for their assigned task)
        - "sounds good, I'll handle it" → status: "in-progress" (for their assigned task)
        - "I'll start this now" → status: "in-progress" (for their assigned task)
        - "I'm on it" → status: "in-progress" (for their assigned task)
        - "I'll take care of this" → status: "in-progress" (for their assigned task)
        - "I've finished it" → status: "completed" (for their assigned task)
        - "it's done" → status: "completed" (for their assigned task)
        - "this is complete" → status: "completed" (for their assigned task)

        If no clear task updates are found or no existing tasks match, return an empty array: []

        IMPORTANT: 
        - Only return taskId values that exist in the existing tasks list above
        - Respond with ONLY the JSON array, no other text or explanation
        - Use intelligent matching - the user might say "finished the report" when the task is "Review quarterly budget report"
        - Consider thread context - if someone replies "I'll start doing it now", match it to their assigned task
        - When users say "it", "this", "that", infer from context what task they're referring to
        - If multiple tasks are assigned to the user, use subject line and email content to determine which one they mean
        - For confirmation replies, assume they're starting work (in-progress status) unless they indicate completion

        Example response:
        [
          {
            "taskId": 123,
            "taskTitle": "Review quarterly budget report",
            "newStatus": "completed"
          },
          {
            "taskId": 456,
            "taskTitle": "Update project documentation",
            "newStatus": "in-progress"
          }
        ]
        
        Thread context example:
        - If user was assigned "Review quarterly budget report" and replies "great, I'll start doing it by now"
        - Return: [{"taskId": 123, "taskTitle": "Review quarterly budget report", "newStatus": "in-progress"}]
      `;
